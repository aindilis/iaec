(2020-05-24 21:13:37 <aindilis> well one of my systems combines GAs with
       educated guesses and some other stuff
 2020-05-24 21:15:48 <aindilis> so basically, I use text understanding
       algorithms to process descriptions of systems, to output a model of the
       OO architecture and functions for that system.
 2020-05-24 21:16:03 <aindilis> descriptions like you get from a research paper
       describing the system
 2020-05-24 21:16:23 <aindilis> I have CiteSeerX circa 2008, so like 43GB
       compressed of research papers in .txt format
 2020-05-24 21:17:11 <aindilis> I have it explode the possible meanings of the
       text, since the algorithm I use outputs ambiguous structures
 2020-05-24 21:17:39 <aindilis> I order these by the probability they are
       correct
 2020-05-24 21:17:42 <aindilis> *estimated
 2020-05-24 21:17:58 <aindilis> it then plies program synthesis tech
 2020-05-24 21:18:11 <aindilis> it then simulates the system
 2020-05-24 21:18:25 <aindilis> and that simulation is what the GA optimizes
 2020-05-24 21:19:07 <aindilis> another thing it uses is CFO (Comprehensive
       Function Ontology)
 2020-05-24 21:19:31 <aindilis> and I suppose it also plies ... hrm forgot, one
       sec
 2020-05-24 21:19:57 <aindilis> ah yeah MKM mathematical knowledge management,
       specifically the Perform KB about Data structures and algorithms
 2020-05-24 21:20:15 <aindilis> here is the quote describing this system: "One
       possible thing to do to get the auto-programmer and the IAEC and
       system-implementor working, would be to have it try out every different
       possibility of mereological type such as when KNext is saying that
       something may be a certain way, but it is unclear which way it is.
       Could also order them by probability, such as by using WSD results.
 2020-05-24 21:20:18 <aindilis> This way, the program can direct it's
       evolution.  Then we can simulate everything from the structure describe
       by the text, as input to the program for trying to evolve programs to
       solve problems.  Awesome."
 2020-05-24 21:20:35 <aindilis> Going to factor this off of IAEC now into it's
       own system.
 2020-05-24 21:21:36 <aindilis> so it's a bit of legoshaking, but the legos are
       pressured into likely configurations
