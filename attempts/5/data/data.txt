(work on IAEC and NLU)
(have the system map out Cyc)
(figure out how represent Cyc and natural language, come up with
 sort of EBMT stuff)
(start translating manually)
(use existing translation service where appropriate to bootstrap)

(but this is opposite our goal to use existing software)
(but can't get people to work on packaging existing software)

(had a good feeling today.  something to dominate our problems.
 like back when AI had first come out.  oh, it was cause of the
 MOSES opencog system.)
(change name of IAEC to be less controversial)
(integrate MOSES with IAEC)
(package MOSES, etc.)

(Knowledge often refers to other knowledge.  for instance, IAEC,
 as we used it, requires the definition of the different files and
 all the relationships with the other files, in order to truly
 understand what it is.  Ergo get KBFS working.)

(PrologCYC is incomplete)
(Get hard drive for PrologCYC)

(We see the concomitant mistake - that I can just invent
 everything myself, as though other people's observations were
 for not.  We must also index all the machine learning research
 and such.  Get the deep learning stuff.)
