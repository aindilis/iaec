	 Semantic controls:  Purpose of  short-description is to  provide a

	 3.4.1 The single line synopsis

	 The single line synopsis should be kept brief - certainly under 80
	 characters.

	 Do not include the package  name in the synopsis line. The display
	 software knows how to display this already, and you do not need to
	 state it. Remember  that in many situations the  user may only see
	 the synopsis line - make it  as informative as you can.

  <medium-description>
    IAEC uses a persistence mechanism and a pending Sayer2
    implementation which tracks multiple invocations over time to
    detect changes and also has a KB about the functions themselves.
    It uses different logics to assert functional relationships in a
    lispish/prologish notation.  It keeps a blackboard of the state of
    all the different problems it's working on.  It can represent
    strings in more economical ways by refering to function evaluation
    results and previously stored data.  It integrates with KBFS, NLU,
    etc.  It also does knowledge discovery and program verification.
    Using KBP systems we will extract a KB of properties about
    algorithms.  It then aids in automatic programming.  It is capable
    of exceeding the transitive closure of it's programming because it
    integrates external data read from books and such into it's own
    system coherently, and thus mines and learns.

	 3.4.2 The extended description

	 Do not try to continue  the single line synopsis into the extended
	 description.  This   will  not   work  correctly  when   the  full
	 description  is  displayed, and  makes  no  sense  where only  the
	 summary (the single line synopsis) is available.

	 The extended description should describe what the package does and
	 how  it relates  to  the rest  of  the system  (in  terms of,  for
	 example, which subsystem it is which part of).

	 The description field  needs to make sense to  anyone, even people
	 who  have  no idea  about  any of  the  things  the package  deals
	 with.[6]
